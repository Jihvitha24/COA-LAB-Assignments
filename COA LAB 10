Write a program in assembly language to print the numbers from 0 to 9.


ORG 100h

MOV CX, 10               ; Set counter for 10 iterations (0 to 9)
MOV AL, '0'              ; Initialize AL with ASCII for '0'

PrintLoop:
    MOV DL, AL           ; Move current ASCII character to DL for output
    MOV AH, 02h          ; DOS function to print a character
    INT 21h              ; Call DOS interrupt to print the character in DL

    INC AL               ; Increment AL to get the next ASCII character
    LOOP PrintLoop       ; Decrement CX and repeat loop if CX is not zero

; Exit program
MOV AH, 4Ch              ; DOS function to terminate program
INT 21h                  ; Terminate program



Write an assembly language program to print the characters from A to Z in reverse order.

MOV CX, 26               ; Set counter for 26 iterations (Z to A)
MOV AL, 'Z'              ; Initialize AL with ASCII for 'Z'

PrintLoop:
    MOV DL, AL           ; Move current ASCII character to DL for output
    MOV AH, 02h          ; DOS function to print a character
    INT 21h              ; Call DOS interrupt to print the character in DL

    DEC AL               ; Decrement AL to get the previous ASCII character
    LOOP PrintLoop       ; Decrement CX and repeat loop if CX is not zero

; Exit program
MOV AH, 4Ch              ; DOS function to terminate program
INT 21h                  ; Terminate program
